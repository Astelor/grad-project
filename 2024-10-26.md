# FPGA-Based Remote Power Side-Channel Attacks

**PAPER READING NOTE, I REPEAT, THIS IS A PAPER READING NOTE**

- FPGA-based power monitor
  - ring oscillators (ROs)
- FPGA-to-FPGA attack
- FPGA-to-CPU attack

- reliably recover RSA private key
  - even when secure modular exponentiation function, which inserts delays to yield a constant constant execution time, is used.

# III FPGA-BASED POWER MONITOR

## A operating principle

- power demanded by a CMOS circuit = (static + dynamic) power consumption
- power side-channel attack leverage data-dependent changes
  - so only dynamic power consumption is concerned here
- average dynamic power consumption = (charging + short-circuit) power consumption
  - $P_{dyn}=P_{chrg}+P_{sc}$
---
- **power distribution network** = voltage regulator + decoupling capacitors
  - former: adjust the amount of supplied current
  - latter: as a buffer to handle current variations
- high switching activity -> transient voltage drops in PDN
- combinational logic delay -> inversely proportional to the voltage supplied to each gate
---
- combinational logic delay -> voltage drop -> power consumption + switching activity of the circuit.
- programmed FPGA circuit to measure the combinational logic delay -> use the delay to estimate power consumption
- ring oscillators -> voltmeter
- RO-based power monitor
  - more portable
  - easier to implement across a wide range of FPGAs without careful customizations

## B RO-Based Power Monitor Design

- ring oscillator = odd number of inverters + 1 AND gate inputs(output of the last inverter, enable signal)
- oscillation frequency -> inversely proportional to the time a signal takes to propagate twice around the circuit
- propagation delay -> dependent on process and temperature variations
