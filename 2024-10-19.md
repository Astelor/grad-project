## rsa-reference
- [RFC8017 PKC#1 RSA](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017)

# post-quantum cryptography

the security of PKC relies on the difficulty of `integer factorization problem` (IFP) and `discrete logarithm problem` (DLP) on modern computers.

quantum computers can, however, compute these problems in polynomial time to make the `PKC`s based on `IFP` and `DLP` unsecure.

> "unsecure" is a bit abstract, take a look at `rsa` it's basically computing the large integers (2000 bits or more).
