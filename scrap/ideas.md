# Me (what I want to do)
- Information security
- Verilog HDL (digital ic design requirement)
- Hardware + Info Sec + Software
	- it's a combination for disaster to me

> Isn't it the essence of info sec, protecting the system against myself by designing it to resist how I would exploit it.

# Reading list

- Hardware security module

- Hardware Trojan

# Resource:
- The internet
- Library (textbook)
- Professors (EE, Information Engineering, Math, ideally in univ)
- Graduate students (TA)

# Direction:
- *Side channel attack
- Secure hardware design
- *Cryptography (Purely encryption things)

## Categorizing?
- Red team
	- methods to attack a machine
- Blue team
	- methods to defend a machine
	- > I've never really done hardening 

> most of them requires both, purple teaming

## Scrap
- Malware detection
	- > not really practical to implement as ASIC?
	- > would probably have to be somewhat programmable
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)
	- effective anomaly detection
	- > still, is it really practical to implement with pure hardware?


# Ideas ChatGPT threw me:
- Secure IoT hardware design
- *Lightweight Cryptographic ASIC for IoT security
	- lightweight cryptographic core optimized for low power, low-area applications
	- algorithms like SIMON or SPEK could be explored
- *Secure processor design for embedded systems
	- develop a RSIC-V or custom processor with built-in security features
	- > wtf is RSIC-V
- *Hardware root of trust
	- what is a root of trust?
- Hardware security module

- **Resistance to Side channel attacks (with cryptographic ASIC)**
	- **I found a good book on attacks on RSA, might as well do RSA?**
	- what kind of side channel attack??
	- > ALL KINDS OF SIDE CHANNEL ATTACK!
	- tbh this is purple team, perfect?
	- > but do I need to consider the practicality of the project?
	- > it's a grad project, it's about learning stuff?
	- > colabing with Samantha is out of the question
- Hardware-Based Random number generator
	- Math and physics? it's essentially finding what's proven random and implement it
	- > Info sec where????
	- **you need RNG to generate a key!**
	
## Scrap
- Physically Unclonable Functin (PUF) for Device Authentication
	- > wait isn't big tech companies doing this?
	- > like Apple
	- this one's more physical phenominon than anything

# Hardware 🤝 Security
Application:
- Anything that requires high level of confidentiality or integrity
	- Business
	- Military
	- Governmental Intelligence
- Balance between efficiency and cost effectivity?

# Ehh??
- The more ideal part is that I make a cryptographic ASIC and simulate attack against it. Try to migate the risk and therefore making more secure.
> you already had a plan man lmao

- What even is IoT in this context?
	- **anything that exchange data**

# Fixing skill issue
> This should probably be considered later when the project is decided.

Not really related but is still skill issue:
- Do HTB machines
> wouldn't it be more effective to do a project and learn things about it?

# Difficulty:
> let's no worry about it for now lol

- Could be no one other than me that knows what I'm researching
	- probably have to knock several profs for my project lol
	
- Too difficult to be done in a year and a half
	- with learning verilog during the first half year
	- my information security knowledge is superficial at best

# What I know:

> Doesn't matter here, you gotta learn (a lotta) stuff anyway

~~
- basic attack vectors and its effect
- what exploits and vulnerable code could look like
	- from the cooler and better hackers
~~
